  <h1>Stop Talking to Each Other and Start Buying Things: Response</h1>

  <p>&emsp;Valente has a lot of good points to make about the internet and how it's being used in our daily lives. The way we slowly loop through apps and sites to find something that isn't riddled with ads and external interference is just for it to catch up slowly. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;My personal experience of this is TikTok. I've been using it since it was called musical.ly. When it rebranded the content on it changed in an unexpected way, it became a lot more directly linked to Vine and more skit-based. The app wasn't made for that kind of content, so there was this really fun couple of years where everyone was creative about how they could get text into videos and share their ideas that way. </p>
  
  <p>&emsp;However, once the app had its footing it became a lot more corporate. They started adding advertisements and even made an in-app store so people could buy things. But little by little everything got taken over. Less actual content was showing up and more targeted ads were on my feed. They even added a 2x feature if you wanted to watch videos faster and get the content over with quicker (surprising no one this feature does not work on ads).</p>
  
  <p>&emsp;After it was almost banned, people started moving over to a different app (RedNote). And I'm sure in a few years people will move to a different app, and the loop will continue.</p>

  <p>"It''s the same. It''s always been the same. Stop benefitting from the internet, it's not for you to enjoy, it's for us to use to extract money from you. Stop finding beauty and connection in the world, loneliness is more profitable and easier to control."</p>

  <p>&emsp;However, seeing this as a terrible thing all of the time is a depressing way to live. There are moments of beauty through this. The idea that nerds can always find each other no matter what changes is one of those ideas. Some fanbases have survived so many different internet locations. Star Trek, The X-Files, and a more modern addition to "classic" fanbases Supernatural are all nerds that have stayed strong and united (in theory) no matter what site they need to exist on. People will always find each other through the worst of it, people will always share the content they love. </p>

  <p>&emsp;The "poisoned bar" concept Valente tried to defend isn't wrong, but it's not entirely accurate either. The internet is more like a bar crawl than your local pub, and it's important to keep looking for better and better options instead of just staying in one place. The people you are looking for are out there. The site for those people is there or will be there. All it takes is some patience and hope.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter. They're just names. It doesn't matter who owns them. Because we own ourselves and our words and the minute the jackals arrive is the same minute we put down the first new chairs in the next oasis. We make our place when we're together. We make our magic when we connect, typing hands to typing hands."</p>

  <p>&emsp;It's honestly heartbreaking that the internet is slowly being taken from everyone. That's always been a danger though. There was always a chance that this was where everything would end up. But it's not gone, and that's the beauty of it. There is always hope that people will keep making their sites, posting on the old websites that never caved. I ended up clicking on the DiaryLand link Valente put in the article. There are people still posting how they feel to this day, and people still reading it. That is such a wonderful thing that has come and blossomed from the internet.</p>
